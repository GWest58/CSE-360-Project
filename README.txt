In order to run the software system on GitHub, run the project as it is represented in the master branch.

There are several things to consider when running the software:
	- The main class that kickstarts the application is Login.java
	- The Doctor.java file is responsible for refreshing the repository and giving it a clean slate
	- All passwords are case sensitive
	- There are three default doctors already stored into the system for use. These doctors are:
		- Grant West
